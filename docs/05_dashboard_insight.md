## 🔍 Key Findings

### 1. 📉 Overall OTD Performance is Critically Low
- **54.52%** of shipments were delivered on time
- **35.16%** were late; **10.32%** were in transit or unresolvable
- Monthly OTD rate fluctuated between **56.5% – 63.8%** with no improvement trend — confirming a structural problem

### 2. 🚨 Padma Freight Co. is the Worst-Performing Carrier
- Highest late rate: **41.17%** — 3.29% above the next worst carrier
- When late, cost is **+15.11 BDT higher** than on-time shipments — the largest cost penalty of any carrier
- Represents a dual problem: worst reliability and highest cost impact on delays

### 3. ⏱️ Meghna Transport Ltd. Has the Longest Delays
- Late rate: **39.12%** (third highest)
- Average delay days: **0.89 days** — highest among all carriers
- When Meghna is late, delays are more severe than any other carrier

### 4. 🗺️ Chittagong is the Worst-Performing Region
- Regional late rate: **36.00%** — highest among 5 regions
- Worst individual route: **Rajshahi Rural Belt (37.64%)**
- Rural routes consistently underperform urban routes across all regions — a systematic infrastructure gap

**Top 3 worst routes:**
| Route | Late % |
|---|---|
| Rajshahi Rural Belt | 37.64% |
| Sylhet Outskirts | 37.23% |
| Chittagong Port Area | 37.12% |

### 5. 📅 Week-Start Delays Point to Operational Backlog
- **Tuesday: 43.15%** and **Monday: 41.01%** — significantly higher than the rest of the week
- **Saturday: 37.05%** — best performing day
- Gap between Tuesday and Saturday: **~6%** — addressable through scheduling adjustments

### 6. 💰 Delay and Cost are Weakly Correlated
- Overall cost difference between late and on-time shipments: **~3.83 BDT**
- Delay is primarily a **service quality problem**, not a cost driver — except for Padma Freight Co.

## ✅ Recommendations

### Recommendation 1 — 🔄 Review Padma Freight Co. Contract
Padma Freight Co. has the highest late rate (41.17%) and the highest cost penalty on delays. Immediate actions:
- Initiate SLA renegotiation with stricter on-time delivery clauses and financial penalties for breaches
- Pilot a partial route reallocation to **Karatoa Express** (best performer at 37.88%) on Padma's highest-volume routes
- Set a 90-day performance review window; if no improvement, consider full replacement

### Recommendation 2 — 🛣️ Strengthen Rural Route Coverage
Rural routes underperform urban routes in every region. The top 3 worst routes (Rajshahi Rural Belt, Sylhet Outskirts, Chittagong Port Area) require targeted intervention:
- Assign dedicated carriers with rural delivery experience to these routes
- Negotiate route-specific SLAs with realistic lead times reflecting rural distances
- Investigate whether **Khulna Rural Belt (30.12% late rate)** — the best rural route — can serve as an operational benchmark for other rural routes

### Recommendation 3 — 📆 Redistribute Monday–Tuesday Shipment Load
The Monday–Tuesday delay spike (41–43%) strongly suggests a weekend backlog effect. To address this:
- Increase Friday and Saturday processing capacity to clear weekend-accumulated orders before the week begins
- Allocate additional carrier capacity specifically for Monday–Tuesday dispatch
- Monitor the impact over 4 weeks to confirm improvement
